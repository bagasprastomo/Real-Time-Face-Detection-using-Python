# Real-Time-Face-Detection-using-Python
A simple program to detect any faces in real-time, it utilizes advanced algorithms and deep learning to accurately identify faces in real-time. Using OpenCV cascade classifier and image processing features to detect faces and put a border around it. It works smooth with a little code.
